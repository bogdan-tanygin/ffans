Ferrofluid Aggregates Nano Simulator (FFANS) is a cross-platform scientific ferrofluid simulation platform

## About

Ab initio molecular dynamics and micromagnetics based simulation and interactive 3D method allows researchers to investigate physical process continuously in most obvious and visual form. Atomic object of simulation is a ferrofluid nanoparticle. Product is written in C/C++ (physical process simulation) and OpenGL (3D graphics). The Qt framework is used to develop cross-platform GUI and other system-dependent layers.||
